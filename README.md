# Pirate Audio RFID Boombox

I'm creating a Raspberry Pi-based RFID boombox using the Pirate Audio bonnet from Pimoroni. The project is a work in progress, yet I'm documenting my progress here. I'll finnish with an article on how to build your own, including a custom 3D-printed case and laser etched/cut RFID cartridge designs.

Please bless this mess as I save my work while catching up on Python. üôè
